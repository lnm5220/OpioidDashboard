The speaker exposes this reality that nobody will ever admit to. He over-explains everything from the view out the office window to the intimate details of everyone’s life—from the overweight loner to the secret serial killer.

It talks about the things that go unsaid; how people at the office know about the deep secrets of our home life, but do not talk about it. Instead, the secrets become just blend into the office environment, like a potted plant that is seen but does not stand out.

The speaker accomplishes this by discussing the details of the tragic death of a coworker’s wife in the same unwavering, mundane (normal) tone as he discusses the details of the copier and office refrigerator. This absurd balance manages to make the story both light and deep at the same time."))
